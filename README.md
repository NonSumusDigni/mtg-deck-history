# mtg-deck-history
A collection of MTG decks from tournament results across time.

Currently, this is very much a work in progress. I am in the process of adding decks from every GP top 8, PT/MC top 8, and any equivalent level top 8 (Masters, Nationals, etc.). I am up to (chronologically) 2001 Nationals season. The focus at the moment is adding decks. Future work will involve tools and visualizations based on the data.

## TODO list
(0. Add all the decks)
1. Write style guide (file names, deck names, folder structure, etc.)
2. Write CONTRIBUTING.md to guide possible helpers
3. Set up webhooks to run validation on PRs
4. Set up webhooks to trigger builds of a JSON version of the collection
5. Look into automatic ingestion of contemporary results (from MTG Goldfish or MTG Top 8 maybe)
